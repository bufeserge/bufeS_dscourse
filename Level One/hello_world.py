# L01T01 : Your First Computer Program and Using Variables


# INSTRUCTIONS : write Python code to take in a user’s name using input() and then print out the name.
#               Use the same input and output approach to take in a user’s age and print it out.
#               Finally, print the string “Hello World!” on a new line (the new line will
#               happen by default if you use a separate print statement to the one you
#               used immediately above to print out the age).


# receive name input from user and print at same time
# receive age input from user and print at same time
# print "Hello World!"

print(input("Please enter your name : "))

print(input("Please enter your age : "))

print("Hello World!")
