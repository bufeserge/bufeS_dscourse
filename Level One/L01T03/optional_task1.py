# L01T03: The String and Numerical Data Type


# INSTRUCTIONS : Ask user to enter three sides of a triangle
#                Calc area of triangle and then print this area out


# Get user to enter three numbers and store them as respective vars as integers
# create var s which is semi-perimeter of triangle = (a+b+c)/2
# use s in formula A = âˆš[s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)] where A = area of triangle, which means import math to use sqrt()

import math

all_sides = int((side_a + side_b + side_c) / 2)
print(f"The semi-perimeter of this triangle is : {all_sides}")


area = round(
    math.sqrt(
        all_sides * (all_sides - side_a) * (all_sides - side_b) * (all_sides - side_c)
