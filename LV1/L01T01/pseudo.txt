        //An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

                create variable highest_posi and set it to zero
                request integer from user
                if integer is less than zero

            //An algorithm that asks a user to enter a positive number repeatedly until the user enters a zero value, then determines and outputs the largest of the numbers that were input.

                create variable first_name and set it so an empty string

                set var first_name to the string entered from user
                print the var first_name plus a space plus "Hello, World."

            


            //An algorithm that reads an arbitrary number of integers and then returns their arithmetic average.

                create an array called array_num and set it to empty
                create variable avg and set it to empty
                get integer from user
                add integer to array array_num
                set avg by adding all items of array_num together and divide this by the number of integers in array array_num
                print avg as string      



            //An algorithm that reads a grocery list and prints out the products (in alphabetical order) that are still left to buy.

                get grocery list
                check for unchecked items on the list and add to an array called unbought_list_groceries
                create var char_count and set to 1
                create var item_counter and set to 1
                create var item_length and set to length of characters of item_counter of the list
                while char_count is < or = item_length AND item_counter is < or = number of items in array unbought_list_groceries
                    if item one char_count is > than item two's char-count
                        swap item one and two in array unbought_list_groceries
                    if item one char_count is = to item two's char-count
                        increase char_count by 1

            //An algorithm for the following flowchart: START - READ X,Y - S=X+Y;A=S/2;P=XxY - WRITE S,A,P - STOP

                create variables X, Y, S, A and P and set them all to zero
                read and store values for X and Y in respective variables
                set S to X + X
                set A to S divided by two
                set P to X times Y
                print var S, A and P as string and with comas in between.
