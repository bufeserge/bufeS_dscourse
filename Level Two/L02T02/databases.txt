1. Define each of the following terms:
/////////////////////////////////////

	a) Data
			→ Data are raw, unprocessed facts or values, like names, numbers, or dates, which on their own don’t have meaningful context.

	b) Field
			→ A field is a single piece of data or a category of data, like a column in a table (like "C_NAME" or "MANAGER_PHONE").

	c) Record
			→ A record is a complete set of related fields that represent a single item or entry (e.g. all the data for one customer or one project).

	d) File
			→ A file is a collection of related records stored together, such as a file containing all customer information or project details.

2. What is a DBMS and what are its advantages?
/////////////////////////////////////////////

			A DBMS (Database Management System) is software that allows users and applications to interact with a database.
			It manages access, storage, modification, and retrieval of data efficiently.

			Advantages of a DBMS include:
				- Better data sharing across users and applications.
				- Improved data integration for a unified view of operations.
				- Minimised data inconsistency via normalisation.
				- Faster access and querying through a dedicated engine.
				- Better decision-making due to more accurate and integrated information.
				- Higher productivity through simplified data access and use.


//////////////////////////////////////////////////////
3. Explain the difference between data and information.
/////////////////////////////////////////////////////

			- Data: Unprocessed raw facts (e.g., numbers, text, dates) without context.
			- Information: Processed or organised data that has meaning and can be used for decision-making (e.g., monthly sales totals).



////////////////////
4. What is metadata?
///////////////////

			Metadata is data about data. It describes the characteristics and structure of the data,
			such as data types, length, relationships, or rules (e.g., "field X must be numeric",
			or "C_NAME is a text field for customer names").
