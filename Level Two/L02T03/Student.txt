L02T03 : SQL


INSTRUCTION: 1. Open the JDoodle SQL IDE: https://www.jdoodle.com/execute-sql-online/
             2. Create a table called `Student` with the following fields and data types:
             3. Insert the data rows into the `Student` table:
             4. Write a SELECT query to return all records where COURSE_CODE is '305'.
             5. Write an UPDATE query to change the COURSE_CODE to '304' for the student with STU_NUM equal to '07'.
             6. Write a DELETE query to remove the row for Jamie Lannister.
             7. Write an UPDATE query to change PROJ_NUM to 14 for students who:
                    - started before 2016-01-01
                    - and have COURSE_CODE >= '201'
             8. Write a DROP TABLE statement to completely delete the Student table.
             9. Copy all your tested SQL code into a file named 'Student.txt'

main goal is to demonstrate that i can use basic sql commands to create a table, insert data, and run queries.  
i will begin by writing a create table statement using the correct data types and setting a primary key.  
then, i will add multiple student records using insert statements.  
after that, i’ll run select, update, and delete queries to test my understanding of how to work with the data.  
i’ll use the jdoodle sql ide to test everything before copying the final code into a text file for submission.  
i plan to take it step-by-step, making sure each command works before moving on to the next part.  


-- 1. Create the Student table with appropriate data types and constraints
CREATE TABLE Student (
    STU_NUM CHAR(6) PRIMARY KEY,
    STU_SNAME VARCHAR(15),
    STU_FNAME VARCHAR(15),
    STU_INITIAL CHAR(1),
    STU_STARTDATE DATE,
    COURSE_CODE CHAR(3),
    PROJ_NUM INT(2)
);

-- 2. Insert data rows into the Student table
INSERT INTO Student (STU_NUM, STU_SNAME, STU_FNAME, STU_INITIAL, STU_STARTDATE, COURSE_CODE, PROJ_NUM)
VALUES
('01', 'Snow', 'Jon', 'E', '2014-04-05', '201', 6),
('02', 'Stark', 'Arya', 'C', '2017-07-12', '305', 11),
('03', 'Lannister', 'Jamie', 'C', '2012-09-05', '101', 2),
('04', 'Lannister', 'Cercei', 'J', '2012-09-05', '101', 2),
('05', 'Greyjoy', 'Theon', 'I', '2015-12-09', '402', 14),
('06', 'Tyrell', 'Margaery', 'Y', '2017-07-12', '305', 10),
('07', 'Baratheon', 'Tommen', 'R', '2019-06-13', '201', 5);

-- 3. Retrieve all records with a COURSE_CODE of 305
SELECT * FROM Student
WHERE COURSE_CODE = '305';

-- 4. Update course code to 304 for the student with student number 07
UPDATE Student
SET COURSE_CODE = '304'
WHERE STU_NUM = '07';

-- 5. Delete the row for Jamie Lannister with exact matching criteria
DELETE FROM Student
WHERE STU_SNAME = 'Lannister'
AND STU_FNAME = 'Jamie'
AND STU_STARTDATE = '2012-09-05'
AND COURSE_CODE = '101'
AND PROJ_NUM = 2;

-- 6. Update PROJ_NUM to 14 for students who started before 2016-01-01 and have COURSE_CODE >= 201
UPDATE Student
SET PROJ_NUM = 14
WHERE STU_STARTDATE < '2016-01-01'
AND COURSE_CODE >= '201';

-- 7. Drop the Student table entirely
DROP TABLE Student;
