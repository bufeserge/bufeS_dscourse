STATISTICS TASK - COMPULSORY TASK 1

1. MEAN, MEDIAN OR MODE?

- You are doing population statistics. You are asked to give an estimate
	of the typical income of a single person in the country. There is one
	snag: wealth distribution is out of whack, and 10% of the population
	holds 70% of the nation’s wealth.
  ---Use the MEDIAN.

- You are running a restaurant, and you are reviewing your menu. You
	have a list of all orders over the last six months. You are trying to find
	out which item you should keep based on what customers seem to
	like the most.
  ---Use the MODE.

- You have been buying electricity once a month for the first six months
	of the year. You are trying to budget your electricity for the rest of the
	year and therefore need to estimate how much you will spend for the
	remainder of the year.
  ---Use the MEAN.

- You work in healthcare insurance. You are asked to provide an estimate
	of the typical amount of money spent on healthcare. This is taking into
	account the fact that there are a few people who spend a large
	amount of money on medical healthcare due to major issues.
  ---Use the MEDIAN.

2. VARIANCE OR STANDARD DEVIATION?

- You are choosing a new Internet provider. You find two providers with
	the same mean speed, but you want to have a more stable connection.
	You get a list of all reported speeds over the last month and are trying
	to find the provider that doesn’t move too much from the mean value.
  ---Use VARIANCE.

- You are going on holiday to Mauritius. You need to find a shuttle from
	the airport to your hotel, but you are worried about being overcharged
	or undercharged (being undercharged might mean that you get
	unreliable transport). You get a list of all available shuttle service prices
	and need to find out which services, if any, are overcharging or
	undercharging.
  ---Use STANDARD DEVIATION.
